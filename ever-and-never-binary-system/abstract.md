# Abstract

Cryptocurrency's main use case is a store of value and participation in the success of the smart contract platform. Token stability is a separate use case that can not be realized within the framework of the same token. We propose a binary system design where interaction between two tokens, the native cryptocurrency of Everscale platform and a stablecoin backed by it, guarantees the price stability of the latter and allows for algorithmic monetary policy of the former.
