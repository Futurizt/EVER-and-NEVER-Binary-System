# V. Conclusion

* We have introduced above a tightly-coupled system of two tokens, the native Everscale currency EVER and its binary companion NEVER stable currency. As a consequence the system does not require any additional governance, since all its actions are governed by smart contracts or, whenever necessary, it relies on EVER native token governance and security guarantees.
* The proposed system allows us to have two native Everscale cryptocurrencies, one for each of the basic use cases: the store of value/participation and the medium of exchange of stable coin.&#x20;
* The prices are provided by Everscale DePool participants and validated using the adjusted Schelling mechanism, adding suspiciousness ranking, slashing algorithm, distribution properties analysis and secondary after auction corrections both for consensus value and slashing adjustments.
* The incentive scheme is proposed allowing validators to earn extra income on the same stake.&#x20;
* The system uses EVER reserves as a virtually unlimited guarantee for Never, therefore no overcollaterization is necessary.
* The Vickery auction mechanism for price control and qualification is used for NEVER purchases  and the reverse Black Scholes price discovery equation is used for NEVER derivatives.
